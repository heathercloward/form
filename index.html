                <li>Conduct. Except and only to the extent that the exclusions and limits of this Section are prohibited by applicable law, Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to discover or modify in any way the underlying source code of the Universal Connect Services, or any part thereof. In addition, Customer may not: (i) modify, translate, localize, adapt, rent, lease, loan, create or prepare derivative works of, or attempt to file a patent application based on the Universal Connect Services, documentation, or any part thereof; (ii) resell, sublicense or distribute the Universal Connect Services or documentation except as expressly permitted by these End User Terms; (iii) provide, make available to, or permit use of the Universal Connect Services, in whole or in part, by any third party except as expressly set forth herein or in the applicable order and subject to the requirements set forth in Section 2(c) above; (iv) use the Universal Connect Services or anything provided hereunder to create or enhance a competitive offering or for any other purpose which is competitive to BackOffice or its licensor(s), (v) perform any other act which would result in a misappropriation or infringement of BackOffice or its licensor(s)’ intellectual property rights in the Universal Connect Services or the Documentation (vi) attempt to use or gain unauthorized access to BackOffice’s, its licensors, or its supplier’s networks or equipment; (vii) probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Universal Connect Services, or a system, account or network of BackOffice or any of BackOffice’s suppliers; (viii) engage in fraudulent, offensive or illegal activity; (ix) intentionally engage in any activity that infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any individual or third party or transmit through the Universal Connect Services any data or information without the legal right to do so; or (x) transmit unsolicited bulk or commercial messages or intentionally distribute worms, Trojan horses, viruses, corrupted files or any similar items; or (xi) restrict, inhibit, interfere or attempt to interfere with the ability of any other person to use or enjoy the Universal Connect Services or a user’s network, or cause a performance degradation to any facilities used to provide the Universal Connect Services. Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth in these End User Terms, the terms and restrictions set forth herein shall not prevent or restrict Customer from exercising additional or different rights to any open source software that may be contained in or provided with the Universal Connect Services in accordance with the applicable open source licenses. Customer may not use any license keys or other license access devices not provided by BackOffice, including but not limited to “pirate keys”, to install or access the Universal Connect Services.</li>
                <li>Personal Data. BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors will have no liability to Customer for any breach of this Section resulting from BackOffice’s, its Affiliates’ and/or licensors’ compliance with Customer’s system configurations or instructions with respect to the Personal Data. Customer acknowledges that BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors does not sell a data storage service. Customer retains responsibility for all data that Customer integrates through the Universal Connect Services, and Customer – not BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors – is responsible for ensuring that the data subjects (who the data pertains to) of any data transmitted by Customer have consented to the processing of the Personal Data by BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors. Except as permitted herein or to the extent required by Privacy Laws or legal process, BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors will implement reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or access to Personal Data by third parties, and will only store and process Personal Data as required to fulfill its obligations under these End User Terms and any applicable orders and/or as required by the Privacy Laws. Each party will comply with the Privacy Laws that are applicable to it in relation to the processing of Personal Data under these End User Terms. BackOffice will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any disclosure of or access to the Personal Data by a third party in breach of this Section and will reasonably cooperate with Customer to reasonably remediate the effects of such disclosure or access. Customer authorizes BackOffice, in connection with the provision of the Universal Connect Services, or in the normal course of business, to make worldwide transfers of Personal Data to its subprocessors (any processor (including without limitation an Affiliate and/or subcontractor) engaged by BackOffice, who agrees to receive from BackOffice, or from another BackOffice sub-processor, Personal Data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the Customer under the terms of these End User Terms and the written subcontract). When making such transfers, BackOffice will ensure appropriate protection is in place to safeguard the Personal Data transferred under or in connection with these End User Terms. Customer’s exclusive remedy and BackOffice’s sole obligation for any breach of this Personal Data section will be for BackOffice to pay or reimburse Customer for (a) the reasonable costs of notification, credit monitoring, and call center support, each to the extent made necessary by the breach and required by applicable law and (b) any governmental fines assessed against Customer to the extent incurred as a result of the breach. Customer hereby (i) represents that it has the right to transfer the Personal Data to BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors, and (ii) instructs BackOffice, its Affiliates and licensors to process the Personal Data for the purposes of performing its obligations and complying with its rights under these End User Terms and any applicable orders. Customer agrees that Personal Data may be sent to BackOffice’s third-party service providers as part of support services and therefore authorizes BackOffice to appoint and use subprocessors where necessary for the provision of the Universal Connect Services. Customer understands that if Customer configures Universal Connect Services to move data from one point to another, that Customer is responsible to ensure that Customer is rightfully integrating data among connected systems, whether Customer transmits data outside of a particular cloud or system, outside of a particular geography, or otherwise. Customers are responsible to set applicable purge data settings and to configure Universal Connect Services in a manner that best fits Customer’s security needs.</li>
